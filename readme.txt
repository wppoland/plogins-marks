Automatic and manual product badges for WooCommerce — CSS-only, no layout shift.

== Description ==

Marks adds product badges to your WooCommerce storefront. Automatic badges appear
on their own based on each product's state — **Sale**, **New**, **Low stock** and
**Bestseller** — and you can attach a single manual badge to individual products
via a store-wide label and colour.

Badges render with plain CSS — no JavaScript — and are positioned over the product
image so they never reflow the layout (no Cumulative Layout Shift). They show on
both the single product page and shop/category listings.

Configuration lives under a top-level **Marks** admin menu: a global on/off
toggle, placement controls, per-rule toggles with custom labels, thresholds, an
appearance section (shape, uppercase, per-context caps) and the manual badge
label and colour. Settings are sanitised and clamped on save.

= Features =

* Automatic badges: Sale, New, Low stock, Bestseller, Discount percent, Free shipping, Out of stock.
* Custom label text for every automatic badge.
* Configurable thresholds: newness window, low-stock level, bestseller sales.
* Free-shipping detection by product shipping class.
* Placement controls: single product page and/or shop and category listings.
* Appearance controls: pill or square shape, uppercase, and a per-context badge cap.
* `[marks_badges]` shortcode to place badges anywhere.
* A single manual badge (label + colour) shown per product via meta.
* CSS-only rendering — no JavaScript, no layout shift.
* Global on/off toggle and per-rule toggles.
* Translation ready (POT included) and clean uninstall.
* HPOS and cart/checkout blocks compatible.

= The [marks_badges] shortcode =

Place a product's badge group anywhere with `[marks_badges]`. It uses the current
product in product loops and on the single product page. Pass `id` to target a
specific product and `context` (`single` or `loop`) to switch the render style:

`[marks_badges id="123" context="loop"]`

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/marks`, or install via Plugins → Add New.
2. Activate it. WooCommerce must be active.
3. Go to the **Marks** menu, enable badges, and choose which automatic badges to show.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it require WooCommerce? =

Yes.

= When does the "New" badge show? =

On products created within the newness window (30 days by default).

= When does the "Low stock" badge show? =

On stock-managed products whose remaining quantity is at or below the configured
low-stock threshold.

= How do I add a manual badge to a single product? =

Set the manual badge label and colour on the Marks settings screen, then set the
product meta `_marks_manual_text` (and optionally `_marks_manual_style`) on the
products that should display it.
